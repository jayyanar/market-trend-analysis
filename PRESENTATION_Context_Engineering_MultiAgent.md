## Slide 3: The Current Reality - Prompt-Only Limitations
### Why Traditional Approaches Fail in Multi-Agent Systems

**Single Agent Prompt Limitations:**
- ❌ No memory between interactions
- ❌ Cannot learn from past decisions
- ❌ Loses context across sessions
- ❌ Generic responses for all users
- ❌ No coordination capabilities

**Multi-Agent Prompt Chaos:**
- 🔄 Agents work in isolation
- 📊 Duplicate work and conflicting decisions
- 🎯 No shared understanding of goals
- 💔 Broken handoffs between agents
- 🔀 Inconsistent user experience

---

## Slide 4: Real-World Problem - Healthcare Example
### When Prompt-Only Multi-Agents Fail

**Scenario**: Patient Care Coordination System

**Agent 1 (Diagnosis)**: "Patient has diabetes, recommend diet plan"
**Agent 2 (Treatment)**: "What's the patient's medical history?" ❌ *No context*
**Agent 3 (Pharmacy)**: "Which medications were prescribed?" ❌ *No memory*
**Agent 4 (Follow-up)**: "What was the treatment outcome?" ❌ *Lost information*

**Result**: Fragmented care, repeated questions, medical errors

---

## Slide 5: Multi-Agent Workflow Challenges
### The Coordination Crisis

**1. Context Isolation**
- Each agent starts from zero
- No shared knowledge base
- Repeated information gathering

**2. Goal Misalignment**
- Agents optimize for individual tasks
- No understanding of system objectives
- Conflicting recommendations

**3. Workflow Fragmentation**
- Manual handoffs between agents
- Lost context at transition points
- No end-to-end visibility

**4. Scalability Issues**
- Linear complexity with agent count
- No reusable knowledge patterns
- Expensive re-computation

---

## Slide 6: The Context Engineering Solution
### Beyond Prompts: Intelligent Coordination

**Context Engineering Enables:**

🧠 **Shared Memory**: All agents access common knowledge
🎯 **Goal Alignment**: Coordinated objectives across workflow
🔄 **Seamless Handoffs**: Context preserved between agents
📈 **Learning Systems**: Continuous improvement from interactions
🏗️ **Scalable Architecture**: Add agents without complexity explosion

**Key Principle**: *Agents become specialists in a coordinated orchestra, not isolated performers*

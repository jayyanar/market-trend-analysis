## Slide 3: The Problem - Financial Services Reality
### Brokers Need Intelligent, Contextual Support

**Current Pain Points:**
- 📊 Multiple data sources (stocks, news, research)
- 🔄 Real-time market intelligence required
- 👤 Personalized analysis for each client
- 🧠 Historical context of client preferences
- ⏰ Time-sensitive decision making

**The Challenge**: How do we make AI remember and learn?

---

## Slide 4: Traditional Approaches Fall Short
### Why Current Solutions Don't Work

❌ **No Memory** - Loses context between sessions
❌ **Generic Analysis** - One-size-fits-all responses
❌ **Manual Aggregation** - Brokers do the heavy lifting
❌ **Disconnected Data** - Cannot correlate across sources
❌ **No Learning** - Same mistakes repeated

**Result**: Frustrated brokers, missed opportunities

---

## Slide 5: The Prompt-Only Limitation
### What Prompts Cannot Do

**Session 1:**
```
Broker: "I focus on tech stocks for growth clients"
AI: "Got it, analyzing tech stocks..."
```

**Session 2 (Next Day):**
```
Broker: "What's good for my growth clients?"
AI: "What type of investments do you prefer?"
```

**The Problem**: No persistent memory or learning

---

## Slide 6: Enter Context Engineering
### The Game-Changing Approach

**Context Engineering** enables AI agents to:
- 🧠 **Remember** broker profiles across sessions
- 📈 **Learn** investment preferences over time
- 🔗 **Correlate** real-time data with stored interests

## Slide 14: Use Case 1 - Broker Onboarding
### First Interaction Magic

**Scenario**: Sarah Chen, Goldman Sachs broker

**Conversation:**
```
Sarah: "Hi, I'm Sarah Chen from Goldman Sachs. 
        I focus on tech stocks and growth investing 
        for high-net-worth clients."

Agent: "Welcome Sarah! I've created your profile:
        - Name: Sarah Chen
        - Firm: Goldman Sachs  
        - Focus: Tech growth stocks
        - Client Type: High-net-worth
        
        All future analysis will be tailored to 
        your investment philosophy."
```

**Result**: Instant personalization, no repeated questions

---

## Slide 15: Use Case 2 - Real-Time Stock Analysis
### Contextual Market Intelligence

**Scenario**: Sarah asks about NVIDIA

**Agent Workflow:**
1. **Retrieve Profile** → Sarah's tech focus
2. **Get Live Data** → NVDA: $875, +3.2%
3. **Search News** → AI chip demand surge
4. **Contextual Analysis** → Growth implications

**Response:**
```
"NVDA is up 3.2% to $875 on strong AI demand. 
Given your focus on growth tech for HNW clients, 
this aligns perfectly with your strategy. 
The 15% revenue growth supports your thesis..."
```

---

## Slide 16: Use Case 3 - News Intelligence
### Multi-Source Information Synthesis

**Query**: "Search for AI semiconductor news"

**Agent Actions:**
1. **Context Check** → Sarah's tech preference
2. **Multi-Source Search** → Yahoo, Bloomberg, Reuters
3. **Intelligent Filtering** → Growth-relevant news only
4. **Actionable Insights** → Portfolio implications

**Personalized Output:**
- Prioritizes growth opportunities
- Filters by risk tolerance
- Connects to existing positions
- Suggests client conversation points

---

## Slide 17: Memory in Action - Before vs After
### The Context Engineering Difference

**Without Context Engineering:**
```
User: "What's NVDA doing?"
Agent: "NVDA is at $875, up 3.2%"
User: "Is this good for my clients?"
Agent: "I don't know your client preferences"
```

**With Context Engineering:**
```
User: "What's NVDA doing?"
Agent: "NVDA is at $875, up 3.2%. Given your 
        HNW growth clients and tech focus, this 
        supports your investment thesis. The AI 
        demand cycle aligns with your 12-month 
        outlook..."
```

---

## Slide 18: Profile Learning & Evolution

    response = requests.get(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
    # Process real-time stock data

@tool
def save_broker_profile(broker_name: str, profile_data: str) -> str:
    client = boto3.client('bedrock-agent-runtime')
    client.create_event(
        memoryId=MEMORY_ID,
        actorId=broker_name,
        messages=[
